# Handwritten Digit Recognition

The goal of this project is to recognition digits in images. The project is based on multi-scale processing with Convolutional Neural Networks. The network is trained on the [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

## Requirements
The code is based on Python3 (>=3.7). There are a few dependencies to run the code. The major libraries are listed as follows:
* Tensorflow (>=2.3.0)
